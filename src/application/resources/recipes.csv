Pork and Peanut Dragon Noodles
#Prepare the sauce for the noodles. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, soy sauce, and sriracha.
Set the sauce aside. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Once boiling, add the noodles and boil
until tender. Drain the noodles in a colander. While waiting for the water to boil, crack two eggs into a bowl
then whisk lightly. Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat, then add the eggs and crushed pepper and
lightly scramble the eggs. Avoid over cooking the eggs. Once the noodles have drained, add them to the skillet
with the eggs, then drizzle the sauce over top. Toss the noodles and eggs to coat in the sauce. Top the noodles
with fresh cilantro and sliced green onion, then serve.

Drunken Noodles with Shrimp
#Soak the noodles: Bring the 8 cups (2 L) water to a boil in a large pot.
Remove the pot from the heat and add the rice noodles. Stir very well so they do not
stick, then let soak, stirring frequently, until soft, pliable, and just shy of perfectly
cooked (they should be al dente, just like regular pasta). This process should take 10 to 20 minutes;
check the noodles frequently as the soaking time varies greatly depending on the width and
brand of the noodles. Drain and rinse well with cold water. (If not using the noodles right away, toss them with a little oil to prevent sticking.)
In a medium bowl, whisk together the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, sriracha, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the water.
In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large (12 inch/30 cm) nonstick skillet over medium high heat until shimmering.
Add the shrimp and sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt; cook, tossing occasionally, until the shrimp are opaque and
just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a large bowl and wipe clean.
Spray the skillet with oil; add the eggs and scramble until cooked through.
Transfer the eggs to the bowl with the shrimp.
Add the broccoli to the pan along with 1/8 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/2 cup (120 mL) water.
Cover and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli to the bowl with the shrimp and eggs.
Discard any excess water from the pan and wipe it clean with a moist paper towel.
Return the pan to the stove, increase the heat to high, and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. When
the oil is shimmering, add the light scallions and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the noodles and sauce to the pan and toss with tongs until the noodles absorb the sauce and are
perfectly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. If the noodles remain a bit tough at this point, add 2 tablespoons
water to the skillet and continue to toss and cook until tender. Repeat with more water as necessary.
Add the shrimp, eggs, and broccoli, the dark scallions, and the basil and lime juice to the skillet
and toss until heated through. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. If the noodles seem dry, add another tablespoon

Shrimp Dumpling Lettuce Wraps or Rice Bowls
#To make the quick pickled carrots, combine 1/4 cup rice vinegar with 2 Tbsp water and the honey or sugar.
Add the carrots and stir to combine. Set aside.
To make the dumpling sauce:
Combine 1/4 cup soy sauce with the remaining 3 Tbsp rice vinegar, garlic and sesame oil.
Thinly slice half the ginger (a 1 in piece) along with the dark green top of one scallion. Add to the dumpling sauce.
For the shrimp:
If you are using frozen shrimp, thaw it completely and drain as much water as possible, using a paper towel to pat it dry.
Finely chop with a knife, until it is about the consistency of ground meat. Add to a large mixing bowl.
Mince the white and light green parts of the remaining scallions along with the remaining 1 in piece of ginger
and add them to the bowl with the shrimp.
Season with the remaining 1 Tbsp soy sauce and (if using) the sriracha; stir until completely incorporated.
Set a large lidded skillet over medium heat with 1 tsp oil.
When the oil is hot, add the shrimp mixture and spread it in an even layer. Cook undisturbed for 1 to 2 minutes,
then stir and cover to let the residual steam finish the cooking.
Drain the quick pickled carrots.
To serve, wrap the filling in lettuce leaves and serve with pickled carrots, dumpling sauce, and (if using) more sriracha on the side.
If making rice bowls, omit the lettuce and serve over 3/4 cups cooked rice (not included in macros/points).

Pork and Peanut Dragon Noodles
#Prepare the sauce for the noodles. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, soy sauce, and sriracha.
Set the sauce aside. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Once boiling, add the noodles and boil
until tender. Drain the noodles in a colander. While waiting for the water to boil, crack two eggs into a bowl
then whisk lightly. Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat, then add the eggs and crushed pepper and
lightly scramble the eggs. Avoid over cooking the eggs. Once the noodles have drained, add them to the skillet
with the eggs, then drizzle the sauce over top. Toss the noodles and eggs to coat in the sauce. Top the noodles
with fresh cilantro and sliced green onion, then serve.#10#5#
My classic Dragon Noodle recipe by adding ground pork and chopped peanuts, using a chunky chili garlic sauce in
place of the sriracha, and using some good ramen noodles that I got at the international market. This recipe is
ridiculously easy and soooo rich and delicious. Sweet, salty, sticky, crunchy, and all the noooooodles! These Pork
and Peanut Dragon Noodles are like comfort food x 100. You will never go back to take out. Ever.#$
